## Useing Gemini_pro to creating AI models...

1. First to do anything using **Gemini** we need to get the API key.
2. Then implement that API key in our environment.
3. Used *streamlit* librery to build the UI for the AI.

### **app.py** is an ATS model. who take the user CV, and job description and give the result about how the use fit for that job desctiption.
### **chat.py** is an AI which can chat with you like your texting messages or like you are talking with chat-gpt
### **vision.py** is an AI who use *gemini-pro-vision* to get the pic and describe about the pic content.
